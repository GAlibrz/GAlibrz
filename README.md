# Hi, I’m Ali Bagherzadeh

I am a Master’s student in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen–Nürnberg (FAU)**.  
I currently work as an **R&D Working Student** at **Innomotics**, where I contribute to AI-based systems for industrial data analysis.

My academic interests focus on **machine learning for reasoning and structured decision-making**, particularly in interactive and learning-based systems. I am interested in how models transform unstructured input into consistent internal representations, and how such processes can be learned rather than manually specified.

- Focus on robustness under heterogeneous data distributions

---

### Formal Verification (Course Projects)
Collection of formal verification models developed at FAU.
- Promela (SPIN) and NuSMV specifications
